# Standard Sponsorship packages

From 2021 to 2024, We've been drafting sponsorship package details from the scratch every year with different pricing and benefits. To make decisions earlier and faster and also reach out potential sponsors earlier and on-board returning sponsors easier, We have standard sponsorship packages from 2025. All UbuCon Asia events from 2025 and beyond will use this standard pricing table with few more options added based on local team's needs and some special pricing for local sponsors.

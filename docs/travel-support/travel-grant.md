# Travel grant

For those who have difficulties raising funds for travel to the host city(or country) for attending UbuCon Asia, The Committee provides travel grant for selected applicants. Grants are provided in 2 categories.

## Travel grant for round trip
The committee can provide funding for round trip between your home and the hosting city(or country). Which is usually flight, train, ferry or other inter-city or international transportation. To minimize risks and provide funding for as many people as possible, The committee provides funding for your round trip as reimbursement after the event is finished. This means, that even if you got your grant approval, you will need to book your round trip ticket with your own money first. Then we'll provide reimbursement for that after the event. 

## Accommodations support
The committee can provide accommodation to selected applicants during the event period. In case the committee have secured large blocks of accommodations in advance, you will be assigned to a room and receive confirmation for your accommodation along with some instructions. There could be also cases where the committee did not secure rooms before. In that case, the committee will ask you to book accommodation with your own money and then provide reimbursement after the event.

## Grant priority
Since our budget is always limited, We won't be able to approve everyone who applies. Thus, we'll be approving applicants with consideration on the level of needs the applicant stated in the application and also following priority order.

1. Keynote/Talk/Workshop Speakers* & Organizers
2. Official Ubuntu Members, BoF Moderators(Those who submitted BoF proposal then got selected)*, On-site Volunteers with full time commitment(Selected in advance)
3. Attendees, Lightning talk speakers(In case we accept proposals for Lightning talks earlier in advance)

> - *For sessions with multiple speakers, Up to 2 speakers in the same session will be eligible for this order
